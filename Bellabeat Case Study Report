Bellabeat Case Study - Google Data Analytics

## 1. Introduction
Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products for women. Bellabeat was founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sandro Mur, and has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.
By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat is a successful small company with the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market.

## 2. Ask

2.1 Scenario
Urška Sršen believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company, and an analysis of Bellabeat's available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. The marketing analytics team was asked to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data to gain insights into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights will be used to provide high-level recommendations to help guide marketing strategy for the company.

2.2 Products
Bellabeat offers various products such as Bellabeat app that provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits, and Bellabeat subscription-based membership program that gives users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.
Bellabeat also offers smart devices that track users' activity, sleep, and stress, such as Leaf, which can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip, Time, a wellness watch, and Spring, a water bottle that tracks users' daily water intake.

2.3 Current Marketing Strategy
Bellabeat invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. The company also invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.

2.4 Key Stakeholders
Urška Sršen is Bellabeat's co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, and Sando Mur is a mathematician and also Bellabeat's cofounder, who is a key member of the Bellabeat executive team. Bellabeat consists of a marketing analytics team, where a team of data analysts is responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

2.5 Business Task
The business task is to analyze smart device usage data to gain insights into how consumers are using their non-Bellabeat smart devices (in this case study, FitBit). The insights will then be applied to comparable Bellabeat products, and be used to provide high-level recommendations to help guide marketing strategy for the company.

## 3. Prepare

3.1 About the Data
The name of the dataset used for this case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, consisting of 18 files in CSV file format organized in wide format. The dataset was made available through Mobius, downloaded from Kaggle, provided by Google, with the license of CC0 Public Domain, open access publication. The dataset is made visible to the public. The dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12th March 2016 to 12th May 2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. The publication date of the dataset was on 31st May 2016, and last updated on 16th December 2020, with the current version of Version 1.

3.2 ROCCC Analysis
Reliable: Low as there is no information that the dataset is vetted and proven fit for use.
Original: The dataset is a third-party data where the data was collected from outside sources, Mobius, who did not collect it directly, where Mobius obtained the dataset from Amazon Mechanical Turk.
Comprehensive: The dataset contains multiple fields on daily activity intensity, calories used, daily steps taken, daily sleep duration, and daily weight records.
Current: The data was collected between March 2016 to May 2016, and this case study is being conducted in March 2022. Thus, the data might not be relevant as it does not reflect the current habits of the current population.
Cited: The dataset is cited with the following citation; Furberg, R., Brinton, J., Keating, M., & Ortiz, A. (2016). Crowd-sourced Fitbit datasets 03.12.2016–05.12.2016 [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.53894

3.3 Limitations
Small sample size as only 30 user data are available.
Absence of key characteristics of the participants, such as gender, age, location, and lifestyle.
Gender of the user was not provided. This is important as the product's target market is women.
There are many missing records.

# 4. Process
The case study will focus on users' daily usage of the Fitbit device in order to provide a high-level insight. Thus, the following files from the dataset were selected for data cleaning and analysis;
dailyActivity_merged.csv
dailyCalories_merged.csv
dailyIntensities_merged.csv
dailySteps_merged.csv
sleepDay_merged.csv
weightLogInfo_merged.csv
heartrate_seconds_merged.csv

The following data-cleaning checklist was used as a form of guidance.

Comparing tables to ensure data are similar:
Uploaded the following files onto Big Query;
dailyActivity_merged.csv
dailyCalories_merged.csv
dailyIntensities_merged.csv
dailySteps_merged.csv
Observed the field names in dailyCalories_merged.csv, dailyIntensities_merged.csv, dailySteps_merged.csv files are also reflected in dailyActivity_merged.csv file.
No metadata was provided to confirm the three files have been merged into dailyActivity_merged.csv file.
Performed the following steps to ensure the data are indeed the same, and if so, will be able to remove the three files whose data are already reflected in dailyActivity_merged.csv file.
Used EXCEPT DISTINCT and UNION ALL to compare tables between dailyActivity_merged.csv and dailyCalories_merged.csv.

The query returned no results which indicate that the data in both tables are similar.
Performed the same steps on the other two files.
The query returned no results which also indicates the data in both files are similar in dailyActivity_merged.csv.
Will not be using dailyCalories_merged.csv, dailyIntensities_merged.csv, and dailySteps_merged.csv files from BigQuery as the data are already in dailyActivity_merged.csv file.

Error, unable to upload other CSV files:
Unable to upload other files onto BigQuery as the result prompted an error message. This is due to the format of the date column in the CSV files as the format is not supported by BiqQuery's DATETIME format.

Changed date/time column "type" to STRING, and uploaded:
Uploaded the files and edited the schema manually. Changed the format of the CSV file's date column to STRING in BigQuery, and selected "1" under "Header Rows to Skip" so that the new format will skip the header and be applied to the values.

Separate the date and time into separate columns:
Objective is to separate the SleepDay column into Date and Time columns, by using SPLIT.
Space was used as a delimiter, however, there are 2 spaces, thus, there are 3 outputs, Date, Time, and AM/PM.
Created a temporary table, Table1, by using subquery to store the outputs.

Used CONCAT to merge the Time and AM/PM columns in a temporary table, Table2.

Correctly format Date and Time data from STRING to DATE/TIME respectively:
Correctly formatted Date column from String to Date format in a temporary table, Table3 by using CAST…AS DATE FORMAT syntax.

Correctly formatted Time column from String to Time format in the main query by using PARSE_TIME syntax.

Sort:
Sorted Id, Date and Time columns in ascending order by using ASC under ORDER BY.

Applied the same steps for the other files with date and time formatting errors.

Replaced null values with 0:
Replaced null values with 0 by using IFNULL syntax.

Check for potential errors:
1) Daily_Activity file
Action: Check the number of unique 'Id' by using 'Distinct' and 'Count'.
Findings and Remarks: There are 33 unique 'Id's, despite the description stating that there are 30 participants.
Action: Check for null values in the table by using 'IS NULL' under 'WHERE' clause, and use 'OR' to check every column.
Findings and Remarks: Query returned no results which indicates that there are no null values.
Action: Check for misspellings, inconsistent capitalization, incorrect punctuation, and other typos.
Findings and Remarks: Values in the table are numeric. Checked the name of the columns and no typo was found.
Action: Check for the correct format.
Findings and Remarks: The formats were corrected in the previous steps. Relevant columns were corrected to their relevant format by converting from STRING to DATE and TIME respectively.
Action: Check if the data in 'TotalDistance' and 'TrackerDistance' columns are similar by using 'EXCEPT DISTINCT' and 'UNION ALL'.
Findings and Remarks: The query returned 20 findings out of 940 entries which indicated that the majority of the values from both columns are identical. To use the 'TotalDistance' column and not 'TrackerDistance' after viewing both columns as 'TotalDistance' gives a complete distance fulfilled by the users.
Action: Check if the data in the 'LoggedActivitiesDistance' column are all 0 by using 'WHERE 'LoggedActivitiesDistance' > 0'.
Findings and Remarks: There are 32 out of 940 entries under the 'LoggedActivitiesDistance' column that has data more than 0. Might consider removing the 'LoggedActivitiesDistance' column as it does not provide any insights.

2) Daily_Sleep file
Action: Check for null values in the table by using 'IS NULL' under 'WHERE' clause, and use 'OR' to check every column.
Findings and Remarks: Query returned no results which indicates that there are no null values.
Action: Check for duplicate values by checking if there are more than 1 identical 'SleepDate' entry with reference to each 'Id' by using COUNT, GROUP BY, and HAVING 'SleepDate' > 1.
Findings and Remarks: The query returned 3 results which indicates that there are 3 duplicate entries.
Action: Remove the duplicate rows by using 'WITH AS' to create a temporary table to indicate the duplicate rows by using ROW_NUMBER(), OVER(), PARTITION BY, and ORDER, and proceed to create a new table without the duplicate rows.
Action: Remove 'SleepTime_Formatted' column
Findings and Remarks: Decided to remove the 'SleepTime_Formatted' column as the table is a daily record and the data in 'SleepTime_Formatted' shows 0000 hours, which does not provide any insights.

3) Weight_Log_Info file
Action: Check for null values in the table by using 'IS NULL' under 'WHERE' clause, and use 'OR' to check every column.
Findings and Remarks: Query returned rows with null values.
Action: Replaced 'Null' value with data.
Findings and Remarks: The 'Null' values were replaced with '0' in the previous steps.
Action: Check for duplicate values by checking if there are more than 1 identical 'SleepDate' entries with reference to each 'Id' by using COUNT, GROUP BY, and HAVING 'SleepDate' > 1.
Findings and Remarks: Query returned no results which indicates that there are no duplicate values.
Action: Check for duplicates in 'LogId' column.
Findings and Remarks: Result returned multiple duplicates of LogId. After further investigation, the LogId may be the same however Id, Weights, and BMI data are different. The only duplicate data in the row are Date and Time. This suggests that LogId data are created based on the submitted date and time of the data, and if two individuals submitted their data at the same date and time, the system will generate the same 'LogId'. Therefore, 'LogId' is deemed irrelevant to the case study.
Action: Remove 'IsManualReport' and 'LogId' columns.
Findings and Remarks: Removed the following columns as the data do not provide useful insights.

4) Seconds_Heart_Rate file
Action: Check for null values in the table by using 'IS NULL' under 'WHERE' clause, and use 'OR' to check every column.
Findings and Remarks: Query returned no results which indicates that there are no null values.
Action: Check for duplicates by using 'COUNT', 'GROUP BY', and 'HAVING No_of_Entries > 1'.
Findings and Remarks: Query returned no results which indicates that there are no duplicate values.
Action: Aggregate the data by finding the average value from each Id on a daily basis by using AVG() and ORDER BY.
Findings and Remarks: Result returned the average value of each Id on a daily basis.
In conclusion for the data cleaning process, metadata was not provided thus it was impossible to verify if the data were input correctly, and there was no reference to check if the range and type of data that were supposed to be in the tables were correct.

## 5. Analyze
RStudio will be used for the analysis. However, before importing the files onto RStudio, the four cleaned files will be merged into one file with SQL by using 'FULL OUTER JOIN'.
Null values will be identified by using IS NULL, and replaced with 0 by using IF NULL.

5.1 Analysis with SQL
There are 33 Ids or participants.

The date range is from 12 Apr 2016 to 12 May 2016.

5.2 Analysis with RStudio

## 6. Share

6.1 Method
Google Presentation was selected as a method to create data visualizations to present the key findings and recommendations to the stakeholders. Attached is the link for the followings:
Bellabeat Presentation for Stakeholders

6.2 Key Findings
Low Usage Rate
As the sleep data participants (24 users) is lesser than the daily activity data participants (33 users), this could suggest participants were not willing to put on Fitbit while asleep due to reasons such as comfort.
The weight log data had a low sample size of only 8 participants. Most participants had to upload their weight log manually with Fitbit smart device, which could deter participants from uploading the data as the method could be considered as inconvenient. Some participants could also feel demoralized sharing their weight log data.

Daily Activity / Steps
Participants lead a very active lifestyle as their weekly very active minutes is 148.12 minutes, more than the recommended duration (75 minutes). Very active activities could consist of running, jogging, swimming continuous laps, playing sports, or skipping with a rope.
Participants spent more sedentary minutes on weekdays as compared to weekends.
Participants' daily steps are below the recommended number (10,000 steps), with Sundays observed to have the lowest recorded number (6,933 steps). This could suggest that Sundays could be participants' rest day as most of them would be inactive.
Considering that participants lead a very active lifestyle, the circumstances of the participants could be the potential cause for the low daily steps (7,638 steps) and long sedentary period (16.53 hours). Such circumstances could be due to work or school, where the nature of the event involves prolonged sitting.

Calories
Participants are burning 2,304 calories a day. Considering that the average person burns around 1,800 calories a day doing absolutely nothing, participants did exercises that burn 504 worth of calories daily. A general rule to lose weight is to aim to burn 400 to 500 calories, five days a week during the workouts.
Despite the low number of steps on Sundays, participants maintained a consistent calorie-burning rate throughout the week.

Sleep
Participants slept 7 hours daily and spent 7 hours 38 minutes in bed. This suggests that participants spent 38 minutes awake in bed before falling asleep.
Participants slept less on weekdays (average of 6 hours 53 minutes) compared to weekends.
Participants slept the longest on Sundays (7 hours and 33 minutes), suggesting that participants needed more rest as the next day could be a working day.
Participants had challenges falling asleep on Sundays. Despite the long sleeping hours on Sundays, participants spent 51 minutes awake before falling asleep.

Relationship among variables
Calories:
The relationship between calories and steps has a moderate positive correlation, where participants would burn more calories if they accumulate more steps.
The relationship between calories and very active minutes has a moderate positive correlation, where participants would burn more calories if they spend more minutes on very active activities.
The relationship between calories and fairly active minutes has a weak positive correlation.

Minutes asleep:
The relationship between minutes asleep and sedentary minutes has a moderate negative correlation, where participants would sleep longer if sedentary minutes are reduced.
The relationship between minutes asleep (fixed variable), steps (secondary variable), and very active minutes (secondary variable) have a weak negative correlation.

Minutes awake before asleep:
The relationship between minutes awake before asleep and very active minutes have a weak negative correlation.
Sunday has one of the lowest recorded very active minutes, and the highest recorded minutes awake before falling asleep.

7. Act
Based on the key findings, here are the recommendations:

1. Recommend Bellabeat's Leaf
1.1 Marketing message to increase usage rate
As wearing a watch to sleep can be uncomfortable, market Bellabeat's Leaf as being comfortable to wear even when they are asleep. Showcasing Bellabeat Leaf's comfortability might inspire users to wear the smart device at night and collect more data on their sleeping habits.
Emphasize that Bellabeat Leaf's battery lasts for four months and does not require charging at night.
Focusing the marketing messages on improving sleep and lowering stress, and how the data collected by Bellabeat's Leaf will be able to guide users to make healthy decisions.
Market product's durability when the user is doing vigorous activities.

1.2 Reminder Features
Remind user to sleep after sensing a prolonged awake time in bed.

2. Recommend Bellabeat's Spring
2.1 Marketing message to increase usage rate
Heavily market Bellabeat's Spring as Fitbit does not track hydration levels. Users might be interested to understand their health data with regard to hydration levels.

2.2 Offers
As most users lead a very active lifestyle, they will need a water bottle for hydration, thus, there is an opportunity for demand for water bottles.
Bellabeat could bundle Bellabeat's Spring with Leaf or Time.

3. Recommend Bellabeat App
3.1 Marketing message
Promote weight positivity so users feel encouraged and comfortable inputting their weight often.
How Bellabeat App is able to provide health data to users and ultimately improve users' sleeping habits.
Encourage users to use a wifi-connected scale instead of manual weight entries.

3.2 Features
Allow users to make friends with other users through the app and create leaderboards. This can promote competition and exercise habits.
Allow users to share their progress or achievements via social media. This would create brand awareness for Bellabeat.

4. Recommend Bellabeat Membership
4.1 Offers to increase usage rate
30-day free trial subscription.
Family, couple, or friends plan.
Discounts for Bellabeat smart device products with membership.
Partner with companies and offer discounts for employees.

4.2 Marketing message
Users could feel that they have a personal coach as the programs and guidance are tailored to their habits and objectives.
As most users are trying to lose weight, Bellabeat could highlight how members will receive personalized nutrition guidance in order to achieve their weight goals.

5. Reminder Features
Interrupt long periods of sedentary behaviors, especially on weekdays, with encouragement to be active as this could improve the user's sleeping habit.
Encourage users to increase their step count by taking a break from their sedentary behavior to increase user's calories burned.

6. Organize Events on Sundays
Bellabeat could organize events on Sundays when users are least active. This would increase users' steps and also higher opportunity to achieve high attendance for the event as users would be free.

8. Conclusion
Bellabeat has the potential to further empower women with their products, and with the recommendations above, the users will be able to perform better, tailored to their habits, make well-informed decisions with their health data, and looking elegant at the same time.
